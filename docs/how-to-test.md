## How to test
- In VS Code, change directory (cd) to repo root if not there already, e.g. `cd core-data-repos`
- In the PowerShell terminal, enter this: `python -m http.server`
- In your browser, go to this URL: `http://localhost:8000/index.html`
- You should see the rendered webpage as it will appear on GitHub Pages
- If you save changes and they're not showing, make sure to HARD refresh the page with **Ctrl + F5** (otherwise it'll keep showing an old cache)
- When you're done testing, go back into the PowerShell terminal and type **Ctrl + C** to stop the server
